	<h1>Alpine Linux hardening</h1>
	<p>This is my personal project to keep my Alpine Linux secure :)</p>
	<p>Works done by other projects, like Whonix will be bring here. I haven't manage to develop my own security hardening. Really busy, really hate to look at the computer's screen.</p>
	<p>Help me with crediting+licensing and developing by joining the project. I would give you many control</p>
	<h2>Some security advantages:</h2>
	<p><b>Minimized attack surface</b></p>
	<ul>
		<li>musl libc or muslc: Cleaner codebase, less bloated than glibc, <a href="https://www.dustri.org/b/security-features-of-musl.html">decent exploit mitigations</a>, <a href="https://www.openwall.com/lists/musl/2020/05/13/1">more secure mallocng</a>.</li>
		<li>busybox: lightweight, less attack surface, the code is still bad (at least busybox is better than coreutils)</li>
		<li>Based on minimalism, packages are splitted, you only install anything you need</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Compile packages with PIE and Stack-smashing protection</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Many distros do the same but maybe they are proud that they are one of the really early adopters</li>
	</ul>
